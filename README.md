# House-Price-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning

This dataset predicts the final sales price a buyer would purchase a residential home in Ames and Iowa. 

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
